#1 Game Developer:

Question 1: The Camera sensitivity was fine and smooth. no issues there!
Question 2: The Day/Night cycle went at a pleasant rate! I'd love to see some stars at nighttime.
Question 3: I can build with efficiency, I liked having the selectable blocks on keys rather than the mouse-wheel. It allowed me to place these faster.
Question 4: I'd gladly pay about $3-5 or so for a calming, creative app like this. I'd love to hear some occasional music and to have more blocks to build.
Question 5: Nothing seemed far out of left field, everything seemed cohesive and worked together well.
